This site is a showcase for my most interesting personal projects. My day job deals primarily with writing code and managing servers, so in my free time I like to work on things that exist in the physical world. As much as I would like to have a full shop, I just don’t have the space for it so a lot of my projects are based around microcontrollers. I don’t have any background in electrical engineering, just what I learned while growing up and what I’ve managed to pick up from books, blogs, and videos over the years.
