Each room has one or more wall plates with one coax and two Ethernet runs that connect back to this set of patch panels. The in-wall wiring is all quad-shielded RG-6 coax and Cat 6 Ethernet in order to support any present day needs as well as provide a reasonable level of future-proofing. Some people will suggest pulling optical fiber in the walls but I just don't think it's justified for home use, particularly with 2.5 and 5 gigabit options over Cat 6 becoming available.
