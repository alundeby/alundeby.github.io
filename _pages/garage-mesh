Devices:
Particle Argon and Xenon
Magnetic garage door sensor

My garage is situated underneath the main floor of my home and faces the alley so it's easy to overlook when the garage door has been left open. I wanted an easy way to verify that it was shut without having to walk down three flights of stairs so I decided to build a remote indicator setup. I could have done this over wifi but Particle was in the process of releasing their new mesh devices and I thought this would be the perfect project to try them out on.
