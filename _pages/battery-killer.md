This project was a test of several things:
* PCB design
* ATTiny in-place programming
* Surface mount soldering skills

I had seen people building joule thief circuits to use up the last remaining power from nearly dead batteries but I wanted to do something more complex as a challenge. I decided to build a custom PCB around a single AA battery holder and use it to power an ATTiny85.
