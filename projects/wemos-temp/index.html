<h1>WeMos Temp Sensors</h1>


<p>Hardware:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WeMos D1 mini</li>
  <li>DHT22 temperature sensor module</li>
  <li>Wemos dual base board</li>
  <li>3 x AA battery pack</li>
</ul>

<p>This project was started by my desire to find out what the actual temperatures were for my baseboard heaters at the “Low - Med - High” settings.</p>

<p>Initially I was measuring at a location with a power outlet so I was able to just use a USB adapter for power. The second location I wanted to monitor was a utility closet in my garage that didn’t have an outlet so I needed to come up with another option. I knew that the WeMos module had sleep modes but it wasn’t something that I had ever implemented before.</p>

<p>In my case I was going to be running on batteries so I wanted an absolute minimum of power consumption while the WeMos was idle. The deep sleep mode was perfect as I didn’t need any sort of wifi or CPU function other than a wake up trigger from the real time clock (RTC). This is amazingly simple in code:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ESP.deepSleep(sleep_delay * 1000000); // microseconds</code></p>

<p>On the hardware side all I needed to do was connect pin D0 to RST. The RTC sends a pulse on D0 when the timer expires and triggers a reset of the controller. At that point it starts the normal boot cycle and runs any code as usual. For this project I set it up to connect to wifi, take a temperature reading, send it to the server, and then go back to sleep for another 15 minutes.</p>

The orange jumper wire is the reset trigger, running from D0 to RST.</p>

I’m using a dual base module as it provides an easy way to mount the WeMos to the battery pack with double-sided tape.</p>

3 x AA battery pack wired into the 5v and ground pins on the WeMos module. It works fine for the minimal current draw I need for the WeMos itself plus the DHT22 temp sensor. The device stops working when the batteries get down to around 3.5v or so.</p>
