<h1>Wine Cellar</h1>

<p>This project was about efficient use of space more than anything else. Calling the end result a wine cellar is really an exaggeration. We live in a small space and need to make use of every bit of storage that we can. There is an awkward closet off the garage that has the water main and sewer plumbing so it needs to be accessible but it’s tucked under the stairs so it’s not terribly useful for storage. I couldn’t put any sort of shelving in front of the water shutoff valve so I was left with limited options. I decided that a wall-mounted wine rack would be perfect as it would be out of the way of the plumbing and still easily usable.</p>

I would love to take credit for this idea but I had found it previously somewhere on the internet. A double rail towel bar (Brogrund, $9.99 from IKEA) works perfectly to hold a pair of bottles, looks great, and was easy to adjust to the exact spacing I wanted.</p>

Pre-drilling the mounting holes for the towel bars. I opted for slightly larger gaps between rows in order to hold 1.5L or 1.75L bottles rather than going for maximum density.</p>
