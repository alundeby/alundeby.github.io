<h1>Garage Door Sensor</h1>


        <p>Devices:
Particle Argon and Xenon
Magnetic garage door sensor</p>

<p>My garage is situated underneath the main floor of my home and faces the alley so it’s easy to overlook when the garage door has been left open. I wanted an easy way to verify that it was shut without having to walk down three flights of stairs so I decided to build a remote indicator setup. I could have done this over wifi but Particle was in the process of releasing their new mesh devices and I thought this would be the perfect project to try them out on.</p>

At first I was planning to mount everything near the bottom of the door as that is the way I had always seen it done. After thinking about it I realized that the height didn’t matter, I just needed it to be on a flat section of track. The top of the door ended up being closer to my power supply as well as keeping the sensor up and out of the way.</p>

The sensor comes on a mounting bracket designed to clip to the outside of the track away from the wheels.</p>

The magnetic portion is attached to the door. I selected a location where I could screw into a steel mounting plate rather than the flimsy aluminum skin of the garage door panel.</p>

My first version used a Wemos module as the controller and sent broadcast UDP packets over wifi to the receivers. When the door is open the blue LED is lit.</p>

When the door is closed, the blue LED turns off.</p>
