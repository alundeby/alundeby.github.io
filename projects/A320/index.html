		This is the navigation light strobe sequence based on the actual Airbus A320 aircraft. Airbus uses a set pattern while most Boeing aircraft appear to have independent timing for the top, bottom, tail and wingtip strobes.

		The 0603 LEDs are so small and light that it is impossible to solder them without some way to clamp them in place. I ended up grinding down a pair of tweezers to the exact width
		required to hold a pair of them back-to-back for soldering the wingtip assemblies.

		There is not a lot of space to work with inside of the fuselage. I had to split the ATTiny and shift register as a circuit board containing both wouldn't fit with the wing tabs inserted.

	<div class="article-one">
		<a href="/images/a320/wings_v1.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/wings_v1.jpg" width="100%" /></a>
		With the wingtip LED assemblies complete it was time to mount them on the wings. I cut a notch to help them sit flush with the leading edge of the wing and secured them with clear epoxy. I then ran the
		wires from each wingtip along the underside of the wing and secured it with epoxy as well.

		<h2>Electronics v2</h2>
		<hr />
		While the first version of the electronics assembly worked perfectly, it was bulky and I knew that I could design a more refined setup. I switched from the combination of ATTiny85 and shift register
		to the ATTiny84 which had enough pins so that I could run all of the LEDs and the IR receiver from a single chip. This let me combine all of the electronics into a single circuit board that would fit
		inside the tail section of the aircraft.

	<div class="article-one">
		<h2>Electronics v3</h2>
		<hr />
		The final revision of my electronics package was functionally the same but involved designing a custom printed circuit board (PCB). I was able to switch to a surface mount version of the ATTiny84 and
		power supply which saved some space.
	</div>

	<div class="article-one">
		<a href="/images/a320/v3_populated.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/v3_populated.jpg" width="100%" /></a>
		Having each component name, resistor value, and wiring pin printed on the board greatly sped up the assembly process and reduced errors. Using a PCB also meant that I didn't need to hand wire the back of the board as in previous versions.
		I could have used suface mount resistors as well, but using verical mounting gives almost the same PCB footprint and is much easier to solder by hand.

	<div class="article-one">
		<a href="/images/a320/v3_programming.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/v3_programming.jpg" width="100%" /></a>
		Loading code on the ATTiny84 is simple with an in-circuit serial programming (ICSP) interface via pads included on the circuit board. I use the same TinyISP programmer with a set of pogo-pins to
		connect to the pads and write updated code just like flashing an Arduino over USB.

		<h2>Model Kit</h2>
		<hr />
		My original plan was to start with a typical hobby store model kit. Aircraft kits usually have a hollow fuselage and wings which would provide space for me to run wiring and store the electronics. Unfortunately,
		I wasn't really happy with the 1:144 scale kits as the A320 would be almost a foot long when assembled. I also wasn't able to find the right combination of airline livery and aircraft type that I wanted for my project. What
		I ended up using instead was pre-painted 1:200 scale kits from Hogan Wings.

	<div class="article-one">
		<a href="/images/a320/kit_packaging.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/kit_packaging.jpg" width="100%" /></a>

	</div><div class="article-one">
		Each fuselage contains a zinc weight in order to keep the plane resting on its nose landing gear when not mounted on the included stand. I needed to figure out the minimum size hole that I had to cut

	</div><div class="article-one">
		Once I had the dimensions for the hole worked out I built a cutting jig. I used hot glue to create the actual clamp that holds the fuselage in place. It's safe on the paint and has just enough flex when removed from
		the MDF part of the jig that it's easy to insert and remove the fuselage.

		<h2>3D Insert &amp; Stand</h2>
		<hr />
		Once I had a repeatable way to cut the bottom of the plane out I knew that a 3D printed insert would be my best option for creating a replacement piece. I had originally considered resin molding as that
		would allow an exact replica of the outside of the aircraft but discarded that idea when I started looking at the requirements for the internal portion of the design. I had already done some tinkering
		using Shapeways SLS plastic parts and thought it would provide the right mix of detail and durability for this project.

		<p><a href="/images/a320/3d_insert_v1_postfit.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/3d_insert_v1_postfit.jpg" width="100%" /></a>
		I designed this part to replace the missing section of fuselage. The center cutout was designed to hold a barrel jack which would also serve as the mounting point for the finished aircraft.
	</div>

		<a href="/images/a320/3d_insert_v2.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/3d_insert_v2.jpg" width="100%" /></a>

	</div><div class="article-one">
		The first version of the insert had a tendency to get pushed inside the fuselage near the tail so on the second version I added a support post to keep that from happening. I was worried
		about the strength of such a thin element on my 3D print but the SLS parts are surprisingly strong. I added slots to completely surround the wing tabs and lock the entire assembly in place once they were inserted.
	</div>

	<div class="article-one">
		<a href="/images/a320/v3_insert.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/v3_insert.jpg" width="100%" /></a>
		On the third revision of the insert I reduced the amount of material surrounding the wing tabs to just what was necessary to lock things in place. I enlarged the hole for the bottom LED as it had a tendency to get
		filled in during the printing process on the previous revision. I also improved the match of the 3D-printed curves to the outside of the fuselage in a few places to reduce prep time before painting.

	<div class="article-one">
		<a href="/images/a320/barrel_plug_mount.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/barrel_plug_mount.jpg" width="100%" /></a>
		I needed a way to mount the plane and also a way to provide power so I combined them by using a standard 5.5 x 2.1mm barrel plug held in a custom 3D-printed mounting post. I added a 15&deg; angle so that you could give the plane a more
		dynamic in-flight look by rotating it on the barrel plug.
	</div>

	<div class="article-one">
		<a href="/images/a320/stand_base.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/stand_base.jpg" width="100%" /></a>
		I also wanted a way to mount the plane for desk display so I designed a stand to match the mounting post.

		3D printing from Shapeways is priced based on number of parts so it was cheaper for me to combine multiple copies of the same item in a single model by connecting them with thin strips of material. On arrival
		I was able to simply snip them apart and file down any rough spots like you would with a typical model kit connected by plastic sprues.

		IR receiver modules are mounted in the nose of the aircraft. Due to drilling out the plastic mounting post for the zinc weight I already have a hole for the wiring. It's just dumb luck that the IR modules fit perfectly into

		<a href="/images/a320/barrel_jack_assembly.jpg"><img src="/images/a320/barrel_jack_assembly.jpg" width="100%" /></a>

		The wings are built by first cutting a notch in the wingtip to contain the LED assembly. Clear epoxy is used to secure the LEDs to the wingtip and also to build up a rounded protective layer that matches the shape of the original
		wingtip area that was removed. More epoxy is used to secure the wiring along the underside of the wing. I don't like the exposed wiring but I switched to a light gray coated wire starting with my second build and it's much
